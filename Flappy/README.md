# Flappy Bird Typing Tutor

This game was made verrrry quickly to try and cash in on the crazy popularity of the original. The entire thing was code over 8-10 hours on the weekend, and released to the intertubes on Monday morning.

Accordingly, the code is NOT BEAUTIFUL - even by my standards. Especially the parts dealing with the pipes as pairs (top & bottom pieces). I hacked many many things to make it work as quickly as possible: and I'll start refactoring soon. But just beware: HERE BE DRAGONS!

The most interesting peices are `/screens/MainScreen.js` and `/entities/Bird.js`. I jammed all the typing logic into the bird object if you're looking for that.
